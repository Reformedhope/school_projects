    <h3>How to Apply Lessons Learned from the Great Depression</h3>
    <hr/>
    <div>
    <h5>
      Recent economic times may mirror what American grandparents or
      great-grandparents went through in the Great Depression. While this time
      may be a challenge, it may be an opportunity to look back and learn how
      previous generations coped with tough economic times. Hopefully, we'll
      never need to relive their lessons learned, but at the very least we can
      appreciate their resourcefulness and gain perspective on our own
      situations.

    <b>Steps</b>
    <ol>
      <li >
        Quit using credit. If you don't have the cash to make a purchase, then
        don't buy it. One of the first lessons learned by people who survived
        the Great Depression was to never borrow money unless you have a clear
        plan for how you're going to pay it back. And when layoffs are a
        reality, expecting to pay for it with your Christmas bonus or your next
        paycheck is not a sound plan. If you don't have the money to pay for it
        right now, don't buy it.
      </li>

      <li>
        Enjoy the simple pleasures. During the Depression, people still had fun,
        just not lavishly expensive fun. Children had soapbox derbies, teenagers
        had dance contests, and everyone played Monopoly, did puzzles, read, and
        listened to the radio. Get together to discuss philosophy or pray; play
        poker or make crazy quilt pillows; play instruments and dance. In those
        days, it took some imagination and ingenuity, but they had a lot of fun
        without hanging out at the mall, and you can too. Many of the
        friendships and alliances formed during the Great Depression on the
        basis of such activities stood the test of time.
      </li>

      <li>
        See frugality as a virtue. There's a difference between being frugal and
        being cheap or stingy. A frugal person makes the most of what they have;
        a cheap person is just focused on not spending money. During the Great
        Depression, frugality was seen as a positive trait. Plus, frugality
        requires planning, creativity, and critical thinking - all of which are
        important life skills, regardless of the state of the economy.
      </li>

      <li>
        Reuse, reuse, reuse. The amount of stuff you have should already be
        reduced by your limited spending, and you'll always want to think twice
        before throwing anything away, whether it's into the trash or the
        recycling bin. Get everyone involved, especially children - hold up an
        item that you would normally throw away and ask, "How can we reuse
        this?"
      </li>

      <li>
        Be thankful. When you're economically strapped? Of course. Make a list
        of the top five things you couldn't live without, and chances are, all
        of those things are not possessions. Most of all, be optimistic. As one
        Great Depression survivor said, "I never thought a cloud was so dark
        that I couldn't find a silver lining" (Betty Davison).
