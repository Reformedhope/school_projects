    <h3>10 Fun Cat Facts You Might Not Know</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cats sleep… a lot. On average, cats snooze between 13–16 hours a day.
        That’s nearly two-thirds of their life!
      </li>
      <li>
        Their purr is powerful. A cat’s purr can calm them down—but studies
        suggest it might also help lower stress and blood pressure in humans.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whiskers are sensors. Whiskers aren’t just cute—they help cats measure
        spaces and sense changes in their environment.
      </li>
      <li>
        They land (almost) on their feet. Cats have a flexible backbone and a
        special “righting reflex” that lets them twist mid-air when falling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meowing is just for us. Cats rarely “meow” to each other—it’s a behavior
        they mostly use to communicate with humans.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cats have super hearing. They can detect sounds at frequencies up to
        64,000 Hz—almost twice what a dog can hear.
      </li>
      <li>
        Big jumpers. A healthy cat can leap up to six times their body length in
        a single bound.
      </li>
      <li>
        Every nose is unique. Just like human fingerprints, each cat’s nose
        print is one-of-a-kind.
      </li>
      <li>
        Old souls. The oldest known pet cat lived to be 38 years old! (The
        average housecat lives 12–18 years.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Ancient companions. Cats were domesticated around 10,000 years ago and
        were once worshipped in Ancient Egypt.
      </li>
