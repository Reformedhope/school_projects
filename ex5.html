        We at the Pewtery Barn recognize that in these times of economic
        uncertainty and radically fluctuating savings and investment dollars
        that everyone is more cautious with their disposable income and
        collecting dollars. Although unadvertised, we always have been willing
        to work with any customers on mutually agreed upon lay-away plans. This
        note is just to say if you see an item that you like but are being
        cautious with your collecting budget, feel free to ask about a
        confidential lay-away plan. And as always thank you for your interest in
