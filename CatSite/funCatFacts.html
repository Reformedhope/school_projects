                <p class="paragraph-style-facts">
                  Cats have been companions to humans for thousands of years.
                  The first evidence of domesticated cats dates back around
                  9,000 years in the Near East. Wildcats were drawn to human
                  settlements by the abundance of food, especially rodents, and
                  over time, they became beloved pets. Ancient Egyptians
                  famously revered cats, considering them sacred and often
                  mummifying them alongside their owners.

                </h3>
                <p class="paragraph-style-facts">
                  A group of cats is called a clowder, and individual cats are
                  known for their wide range of vocalizations—over 100 different
                  sounds! Adult cats sleep anywhere from 12 to 16 hours a day,
                  conserving energy for hunting or play, and their highly
                  sensitive whiskers help them measure space and detect tiny
                  movements around them.

                <p class="paragraph-style-facts">
                  Cats are remarkable athletes. They can jump up to five times
                  their own height, run up to 30 miles per hour, and almost
                  always land on their feet thanks to their righting reflex.
                  Their retractable claws let them climb silently and catch
                  prey, and some cats are polydactyl, meaning they have extra
                  toes.

                <p class="paragraph-style-facts">
                  Did you know cats have a third eyelid called the nictitating
                  membrane, which protects their eyes and helps them see in dim
                  light? Their eyes have a reflective layer called the tapetum
                  lucidum, giving them excellent night vision. Some cats even
                  have heterochromia, with two different-colored eyes, and their
                  tongues are covered in tiny backward-facing spines called
                  papillae, perfect for grooming and eating meat.

                <p class="paragraph-style-facts">
                  Cats communicate in unique ways. They often chirp or trill at
                  birds, knead with their paws when happy, and can even form
                  strong bonds with humans. A cat’s purring isn’t just
                  adorable—it can promote healing in bones and tissues. They
                  also use their tails to balance and convey emotion, from
                  excitement to agitation.

                  From black cats bringing luck in some cultures to Maine Coons
                  being the largest domestic breed, cats have captured human
                  fascination for millennia. They can drink saltwater if
                  necessary, have unique nose prints like human fingerprints,
                  and even detect earthquakes with their acute hearing. Life
                  with cats is full of surprises, quirks, and endless joy!
