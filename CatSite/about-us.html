    <h3>About Us</h3>
    <p>
      Welcome to The Cat’s Meow! This site was created out of a simple truth:
      life is better with cats. Whether they’re curling up on the couch, chasing
      a toy across the floor, or just giving us that classic “I’m in charge”
      stare, cats bring endless joy, comfort, and personality into our lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started this site because I’ve always been fascinated by the quirks and
      charms of cats. From the science behind their purring to the way they
      somehow know the exact moment you’re about to sit down, cats are full of
      surprises. My goal is to share what I’ve learned, highlight fun facts, and
      provide helpful tips so that fellow cat lovers—new and experienced
      alike—can celebrate their feline friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, you’ll find guides on cat care, insights into different breeds, and
      lighthearted features that remind us why cats hold such a special place in
      our hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you’ll find this site to be a cozy
      corner of the internet where people who adore cats feel right at home.
