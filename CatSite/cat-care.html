    <h2>Cat Care Basics: Keeping Your Feline Happy & Healthy</h2>
    <h4>🥣 Feeding</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Provide a balanced diet with quality cat food suited to their age
        (kitten, adult, senior).
      </li>
      <li>
        Fresh water should always be available. Cats can be picky drinkers, so
        consider a fountain if your cat doesn’t like bowls.
      </li>
      <li>
        Avoid giving cats human foods like onions, chocolate, or dairy, which
        can make them sick.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>🛁 Litter Box</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Keep at least one litter box per cat in the home (plus an extra if
        possible).
      </li>
      <li>Scoop daily and clean thoroughly each week.</li>
      <li>Place litter boxes in quiet, low-traffic areas for privacy.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>🎾 Play & Exercise</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Cats need daily play to stay active and mentally sharp.</li>
      <li>
        Toys like feather wands, balls, and interactive puzzles are great for
        keeping them entertained.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scratching posts are a must to protect furniture and let cats stretch
        naturally.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>🩺 Vet Care</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Schedule regular vet checkups, vaccinations, and preventative care.
      </li>
      <li>Spaying or neutering your cat helps with health and behavior.</li>
      <li>
        Watch for changes in appetite, litter box habits, or behavior—they can
        be signs of illness.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>❤️ Love & Companionship</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Cats may seem independent, but they thrive on affection.</li>
      <li>Spend time petting, cuddling, and bonding with your cat each day.</li>
      <li>
        Remember: every cat has a unique personality—get to know what makes
        yours happiest.
      </li>
    </ul>
